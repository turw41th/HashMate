# HashMate

HashMate is an easy way to create hash values for files and text. 

## Naming
The name for this project has its origin in the following conversation I had with GPT-4:

*Me:* Please help me find a name for my software project, it is a windows tool that lets you hash strings or files.

*GPT-4:* How about "HashMate"? It's a play on words with "hash" and "mate" meaning friend or companion, suggesting that the tool is a friendly and helpful companion for users who need to hash strings or files. It's also short and memorable, making it easy to remember and search for.

*Me:* That's great, thanks!

*GPT-4:* You're welcome! I'm glad I could help. Good luck with your project!
